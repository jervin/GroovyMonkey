/**
 * GitHub Issues -------------
 *
 * Create a program that generates a report about the the Issues belonging to a
 * list of github repositories ordered by creation time, and information about
 * the day when most Issues were created.
 *
 * Input: ----- List of 1 to n Strings with Github repositories references with
 * the format "owner/repository"
 *
 *
 * Output: ------ String representation of a Json dictionary with the following
 * content:
 *
 * - "issues": List containing all the Issues related to all the repositories
 * provided. The list should be ordered by the Issue "created_at" field (From
 * oldest to newest) Each entry of the list will be a dictionary with basic
 * Issue information: "id", "state", "title", "repository" and "created_at"
 * fields. Issue entry example: { "id": 1, "state": "open", "title": "Found a
 * bug", "repository": "owner1/repository1", "created_at":
 * "2011-04-22T13:33:48Z" }
 *
 * - "top_day": Dictionary with the information of the day when most Issues were
 * created. It will contain the day and the number of Issues that were created
 * on each repository this day If there are more than one "top_day", the latest
 * one should be used. example: { "day": "2011-04-22", "occurrences": {
 * "owner1/repository1": 8, "owner2/repository2": 0, "owner3/repository3": 2 } }
 *
 *
 * Output example: --------------
 *
 * {
 * "issues": [ { "id": 38, "state": "open", "title": "Found a bug",
 * "repository": "owner1/repository1", "created_at": "2011-04-22T13:33:48Z" }, {
 * "id": 23, "state": "open", "title": "Found a bug 2", "repository":
 * "owner1/repository1", "created_at": "2011-04-22T18:24:32Z" }, { "id": 24,
 * "state": "closed", "title": "Feature request", "repository":
 * "owner2/repository2", "created_at": "2011-05-08T09:15:20Z" } ], "top_day": {
 * "day": "2011-04-22", "occurrences": { "owner1/repository1": 2,
 * "owner2/repository2": 0 } } }
 *
 * --------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * You can create the classes and methods you consider. You can use any library
 * you need. Good modularization, error control and code style will be taken
 * into account. Memory usage and execution time will be taken into account.
 *
 * Good Luck!
