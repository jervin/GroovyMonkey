<li>Added Job and Exec-Mode metatags that show that all monkey scripts run from within an Eclipse Job.</li>
<li>Added Groovy Monkey Editor that contains a content outline, run script action, and add dom action.</li>
<li>Added outline view that shows the metadata that the Groovy Monkey runtime will see and the types available in the binding.</li>
<li>Enabled direct navigation via double click from the outline view.</li>
<li>Added Installed DOMs view to list the DOMs that are currently installed in the workbench.</li>
<li>Added the Listener metadata tag to enable scripts to be able to respond to ResourceChangeEvent(s) in the current workspace.</li>

<li>Added Include and Include-Bundle dialogs to Groovy Editor context menu command set.</li>
<li>Added a Java search, modeled on the PDE search, to the outline view to look for all the classes exposed from an included bundle in the set of exported packages.  So if your 'External Plug-in Libraries' project is setup, you should see the classes.</li>
