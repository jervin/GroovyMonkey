<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
Why does this project Groovy Monkey exist?  What need could it possibly meet 
and why should I consider it?  Since I am the author of Groovy Monkey I am bit biased
and could probably tell you how it can create world peace, solve hunger and solve
everything else that ills the world.  I can couch this outrageous statement in enigmatic
abstract language that is intended to make you feel foolish and raise my standing in
your eyes.  Since you can't understand what I am saying, but apparently it can do so
much, then you must try the tool, right?  
</p>

<p>
Well I am not going to do that. This is an Open Source tool that is available for free 
to anybody. So I am not making any money off of this and therefore will dispense with
that kind of introduction. I will try and write the kind of introduction that I 
wish I would get more often when looking at software packages, the story.  What do I
mean by the story?  Well every software ( particularly open source ) started off as an
idea or namely a problem that the developer was trying to address.  The developer
then goes off and bangs out a tool that helps him/her solve their problem.  The developer
being a smart person begins to think that their solution might be useful to others
and then that usually is the start of the project.  As they continue developing the
project, there is a light that goes off and they realize that hey I can make this 
some sort of abstract framework that is useful for just about everything ( read: 
in reality almost nothing ) and announce their product to the world.  When the 
developer gets to this point is when they usually write the documentation and 
leave confusion in their wake.  The point is that I find it far more helpful in
potentially finding the use of a product by hearing that back story, what problem was
targetted and how they resolved it.  This is what I am going to try and do next.

<h3>Eclipse is extensibly complex</h3>

<p>
Anyone who has started out trying to browse around the Eclipse API thinks the title of
this section is a serious understatement.  Do not get me wrong, I love Eclipse.  I think
that the modular architecture, with lazy loading and component descriptors is <b>the</b> 
way to go.  I think that there are many good lessons to be learned about how to write 
good decoupled code by studying the Eclipse Platform API and code.  I am finally even
sold on the migration to the OSGi framework underneath the sheets.  I think that the
Eclipse team has done a good job of "eating their own poo" and providing the ability
to self-host.  Still the API and code can be a <b>bit</b> daunting and the javadocs
can be a bit <b>ahem..</b> terse. So there is a demonstratable need to be able to 
write some test code to exercise those APIs and answer the inevitable questions that 
arise while writing plugins.  The other main area of interest is the ability to automate
some commands in Eclipse or be able to write some form of macro.  I am going to list the 
available "Eclipse" ways of tackling the above problems and highlight the limitations 
of those approaches.
</p>

<h4>Write a workspace plugin and use self hosting</h4>

<p>
The last software development project I was working on, we used Eclipse exclusively.  
As time went by, it became apparent to me that we could use some tools to help us
in our software development.  As I worked on some of these tools, I stumbled upon the
ability to self host Eclipse to write some tool plugins.  I would start a parent Eclipse 
instance with a workspace that contained my tool plugin I was working on and then 
start a runtime Eclipse instance in debug mode that had the workspace of our overall 
software project.  This actually works pretty well if you have a machine with good 
memory resources ( my machine had 2GB of RAM ), but it gets hampered in that it 
has to rely on Java hotswapping, which is far too limited.  Even though the setup
I had allowed self hosting to work pretty well, the inability to run your workspace
plugin against your current workspace and Eclipse instance can be a significant
limitation.  Since the runtime Eclipse instance relies on Java hot swapping, if 
I did something so simple as change a method name in a class of my tool plugin, 
I would have to restart my runtime Eclipse instance.  Even with a nice workstation, 
this would get very annoying.  Of course, this solution is not a good one if you 
don't have a nice workstation to play on.  
</p>

<p>
Still the use of self hosting did have one major advantage, you did not have to mess with
trying to export plugins to an update site and have Eclipse update your plugin in your
current workspace.  In other words, no feature or feature export or having to screw with
the version everytime I wanted to try something new.  Why don't the Eclipse Platform
people fix features and update sites?
</p>

<h4>Scratch Pad</h4>

<p>
I remember hearing about this tool sometime back and then I promptly forgot about it.  
Before I dived into Groovy Monkey I went back and evaluated it.  I think it is a tool
with some potential, but I had a hard time trying to figure out how to do even a simple
example ( there were way to many mouse clicks and the like ).  Even once I got an 
example to work, it still does not run within your current workspace instance, it still
spawns a seperate JVM to evaluate your code and you could not use your current workspace
and its projects to test against the code in the scratchpad.
</p>

<h4>Eclipse Shell</h4>

<p>
<a href="http://eclipse-shell.sourceforge.net/">Eclipse Shell</a> is an open source
project that seems to deal with nearly the same area as Groovy Monkey and it does
seem to be well developed and supported.  In fact, I would recommend people looking
into Groovy Monkey for automation, rapid prototyping and the like take a look at it.
Having said that, one of the things I really wanted was the ability to write my scripts
in the Groovy Scripting Language and Eclipse Shell did not meet that requirement.  
Still I gave it a good look and it may just be my ineptitude, but I found it a bit
tedious and I could not get it to work in the way that I wanted.  So I continued
to search for a tool.
</p>

<h4>Eclipse Monkey</h4>

<p>
<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/dash/">Eclipse Monkey</a> is an open source Eclipse
project that seemed to offer what I wanted.  It enables you to try out some rapid
prototyping and had the beginnings of an ability to dynamically deploy plugins to
your current Eclipse instance in the form of Domain Object Models (DOM(s)).  I was
initially very excited about this project except for one major thing, Eclipse Monkey was
written to solely support Javascript.  I suppose that is the reason for its name,
it is an Eclipse form of the Mozilla Firefox tool Grease Monkey.  Even though Eclipse
Monkey could meet many of the needs that I had it is also only still really a prototype,
very rough around the edges. Monitoring those Dash guys' blogs made me realize that 
they are really busy campers and that Eclipse Monkey was not necesarily high on 
the agenda.  So I began to mess around with the source code and that leads me to 
the next section.
</p>

<h2>Groovy Monkey is born</h2>

<p>
Did I mention I really wanted the scripting tool to support the 
<a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org">Groovy</a> language?  So Groovy Monkey began
life as a Groovy port of the Eclipse Monkey tool.  The name Groovy Monkey came about
because Groovy Eclipse Monkey was just too cumbersome.  The first version of Groovy
Monkey was just this, Eclipse Monkey for Groovy.
</p>

<p>
As time went by the obvious limitations of Eclipse Monkey became too much to avoid.
The biggest one is that all Eclipse Monkey scripts inherently run only in the Eclipse
UI Thread.  This meant that there was no way to cancel a runaway script.  In fact,
a runaway script would completely lock up the entire Eclipse workbench and would force
you to kill the Eclipse Java process to stop it.  Needless to say, this is not acceptable.
The thought occured to me, "Eclipse has already solved this problem, why not run 
the script from within the context of an Eclipse Job like you are supposed to?"  Thus
the Groovy Monkey was split off from Eclipse Monkey to support this.  This lead to the
creation of the <b>Job:</b> and <b>Exec-Mode:</b> metatags to allow you to specify
what kind of Eclipse job to run the script in and to specify whether the job is to
be run in the foreground or background.
</p>

<p>
The next limitation of Eclipse Monkey is that there is no form of help to know what
DOMs, plugins and Java Types are available to the script writer.  To someone familiar
with the Eclipse JDT, this quickly becomes almost unbearable.  This led to the creation
of the Groovy Monkey Editor and a content outline page to be displayed in the Outline
view.  This allows a script writer to know what DOMs are in the scripts binding from
the script metadata and to know their variable name along with the Java type they
represent.  A nice future enhancement to consider would be directly supporting 
code completion, but it is complicated by the fact that Groovy Monkey supports more than
one language as is explained later on.  The editor has other goodies, like right click
menus to allow you to run the script from there and to bring up a dialog to allow you
to include an installed DOM automatically.  As a final touch, there is an "Installed DOMs"
view so that a user can know what DOM plugins are currently installed on the current
running Eclipse workbench.  Future enhancements could include the ability to directly
support DOM plugins in the current workspace and to allow the "Installed DOMs" view
to install, uninstall and update current DOM plugins.
</p>

<p>
The next step in the evolution of Groovy Monkey happened thanks to Groovy.  I was 
attempting to write some code that should have been ok, but at the time was not due
to a limitation ( bug ) in Groovy.  I knew that there was a 
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/bsf/">Bean Scripting Framework (BSF)</a> and a 
<a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=223">JSR-223</a> that should allow a JVM
to invoke scripts dynamically at runtime.  Since JSR-223 looks to be more of a Java 6.0
feature, I went with BSF.  There are many languages that support BSF and since I had
rejected the last two tools in part because they did not support the language I wanted
to use, the thought occured to me, "why not let any language that can support the BSF
be integrated into Groovy Monkey?"  I rewrote Groovy Monkey to use the BSF for Groovy,
Beanshell, Jython (Python), JRuby (Ruby) and even took a stab at Jacl (Tcl).  For the
most part, they all seemed to work fine, though I have had the most success using
Groovy, Beanshell and JRuby.  Groovy Monkey is extensible via the IMonkeyScript and
IMonkeyScriptFactory classes and the net.sf.groovyMonkey.lang extension point to support
other languages that implement a BSF Engine.  Each of the language support modules are
located in Eclipse fragments that have the net.sf.groovyMonkey plugin as their parent.
So it is possible to remove language support you don't want directly and to add in 
more languages as you desire.
</p>

<p>
One other step to note is that since writing and updating DOMs can be somewhat cumbersome
still, Groovy Monkey was enhanced to allow for other ways to include library code.
First, Groovy Monkey has a Runner DOM that allows you to invoke other Groovy Monkey
scripts in your current workspace and to set variables in its binding via a map.
Secondly, there is an <b>Include:</b> metadata tag that allows you to directly include
a jar or directory in the classloader of the script.  Finally, there is an <b>Include-Bundle:</b>
metadata tag that allows you to include currently installed bundles directly in the
classloader of the script.  One note about the last two features, they depend entirely
on the language implementation and its willingness to use the BSF Engine's classloader
correctly.  In other words, I have only really had success, particularly with <b>Include-Bundle:</b>
with the Groovy, Beanshell and JRuby language implementations.
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>
So that in short is the story of how Groovy Monkey began.  It currently has very little
to do with Eclipse Monkey tool and is really now a different product.  I believe it allows
for Eclipse API exploration, automation of Eclipse tasks and for rapid protoyping both
via the use of DOMs and the other include mechanisms.  And yes you Emacs LISP people 
can take the smirk off of your face, I know I almost made Eclipse like Emacs, but you
know no one really wants to write in LISP.
