<h2>Writing a script</h2>
<h3>Script file locations</h3>
<p>
Scripts are installed in the <em>Groovy Monkey</em> menu by placing them in "*.gm" files 
in a top-level "monkey" folder of any project 
(obviously, scripts are un-installed by renaming, moving them or by not specifying 
a Menu: metadata tag at the top of the script). 
The complete set of scripts that can be directly run from the Groovy Monkey menu 
is the union of the scripts in all the top-level monkey folders in the workspace.
</p>

<p>
You can run other monkey scripts as library functions by using the runnerDOM from the
default set of DOMs provided in the binding.  The TestInclude_Groovy.gm under the lib
folder under GroovyMonkeyExamples highlights this in the screenshot below.
</p>

<h3>New Script Wizard</h3>
<p>
To help you create the scripts a wizard has been provided with appropriate choices for
the metadata, except <b>DOM:</b>, <b>Include:</b> and <b>Include-Bundle:</b> tags.  To use
the wizard select a project in the Navigator/Package Explorer view and right click select
New -> Other and choose the <b>New Groovy Monkey Script</b> wizard.
</p>

<center>
<img src="images/selectWizard.png">
</center>

<p>
The wizard will present you with a set of default options.  In the example below
the GroovyMonkeyExamples project was chosen so by default it wants to put the script
in the /GroovyMonkeyExamples/monkey folder.  The Container tag is a string that 
represents a path in the workspace, you can place the script anywhere in the workspace you
like by modifying that path.  The file name tag will need to be changed to the name
you desire.  The other tags and their valid values are explained in their relevant sections
later on in this document.  
</p>

<h3>Script metadata</h3>

<p>
Scripts include metadata that specifiy how a script is to be run and additional 
resources required for successful operation. Metadata consists of keyword values pairs. 
These are placed in the first comment block of the script. 
This must be a /* ... */ style comment. 
Currently the <b>Menu:</b>, <b>DOM:</b>, <b>Include:</b>, <b>Include-Bundle:</b>, 
<b>LANG:</b>, <b>Job:</b>, <b>Exec-Mode:</b> and <b>Listener:</b> metadata tags are recognized.
The <b>Script-Path:</b> metadata tag is maintained automatically by the Groovy Monkey runtime and
represents the workspace path of the script.
</p>

<h3>Supported Languages</h3>

<p>
Groovy Monkey is designed to leverage the Apache Bean Scripting Framework (BSF) ( eventually JSR-223 in Java 6.0 ) 
to allow you to write your Groovy Monkey scripts in any number of languages.  Currently
supported languages are Groovy ( Default - v 1.0-JSR-06 ), Beanshell ( v 2.0b4 ), 
Ruby ( JRuby 0.8.3 ), Python ( Jython v 2.2alpha1 ) and to some extent TCL ( Jacl v 1.3.2 ).
If you do not put a <b>LANG:</b> tag in the metadata or leave it blank, 
Groovy is then automatically selected.  The <b>New Groovy Monkey Script</b> wizard has
a nice drop down box enumerating the available scripting languages that are supported
in Groovy Monkey.
</p>

<h3>Script menus</h3>

<p>
The <b>Menu:</b> metadata tag specifies that this script is to be included in 
the <em>Groovy Monkey</em> menu. If more than one script specifies the same menu item, 
the menu item will appear more than once. Submenus are created using the Eclipse
standard notation "Menu > SubMenu" or "Menu > SubMenu > SubSubMenu" (etc.) in the metadata string.
You can have the script not show up in the <em>Groovy Monkey</em> menu by not including
the <b>Menu:</b> metadata tag or by providing no string.
</p>

<h3>Job Mode</h3>

<p>
Groovy Monkey was designed to exploit not only the Bean Scripting Framework (BSF), but
to also exploit the Eclipse Platform to run these scripts as Eclipse Jobs according to the
Eclipse Jobs API.  This enables Groovy Monkey to provide a Progress Monitor in the default
binding and allow you to write your scripts to be aware that they can not only be monitored,
but also cancelled.  Check out in the following code how you can provide update information
to the progress dialog and can defensively check that the script has been cancelled and
therefore stop the script.  This example is also provided in several language variants in
the GroovyMonkeyExamples project under monkey/FindSystemPrints_Groovy.gm.
</p>
<pre>
<code>
def files = resources.filesMatching( ".*\\.java" )
monitor.beginTask( '', files.size() )
if( monitor.isCanceled() )
    return
for( file in files )
{
    if( monitor.isCanceled() )
        return
    monitor.subTask( 'file: ' + file.getEclipseObject().getName() )
    file.removeMyTasks()
    for( line in file.lines )
    {
        if( monitor.isCanceled() )
            return
        if( line.string.contains( 'System.out.print' ) && !line.string.trim().startsWith( '//' ) ) 
            line.addMyTask( line.string.trim() )
    }
    monitor.worked( 1 )
}
monitor.done()
jface.asyncExec
{
    window.getActivePage().showView( 'org.eclipse.ui.views.TaskList' )
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>
There are three kinds of Jobs that are allowed in Groovy Monkey: <b>Job</b>, 
<b>WorkspaceJob</b> and <b>UIJob</b>.  These correspond to the similiarly named 
Eclipse Job API classes.  
</p>
<p>
By default a Groovy Monkey script will run in <b>Job</b> mode.  The <b>Job</b> mode corresponds
to a normal Eclipse Job instance.  This mode is the recommended one because the UI thread
is not used and the Eclipse Workbench remains responsive.  
</p>
<p>
The <b>WorkspaceJob</b> mode is used to allow the script access to the workspace, its resources 
and to modify them without incremental builders and workspace updates occuring.  It
corresponds to an Eclipse WorkspaceJob instance.
</p>
<p>
The <b>UIJob</b> mode is used to specify that the script is to be run in its entirety from within the SWT UI Thread.  
The use of <b>UIJob</b> is strongly not recommended, because it will cause the UI to become 
unresponsive and will not allow the user to cancel the running script.  Still it is 
provided since there are situations where the script is solely specifing UI elements.  
</p>
<p>
One further note, the runnerDOM in the default binding allows you to provide a runnable that can be called with syncExec or 
asyncExec to allow you to access UI elements from within a script not running in <b>UIJob</b>
mode.  The runnerDOM's methods asyncExec and syncExec are just convienence wrappers to the
Display's asyncExec and syncExec.  For Groovy users you can use the provided jface
binding to call asyncExec and syncExec with a closure ( very groovy and cool of course ).
</p>

<h3>Domain Object Models</h3>
<p>
Groovy Monkey provides the Domain Object Model extension point to allow you to write
Eclipse plugins that can provide a simplified API to the Eclipse Platform or provide
additional functionality.  The <b>DOM:</b> metadata tag allows those plugins to provide
their objects to the binding of the script at runtime.  The Groovy Monkey Editor provides
a content outline that will show the doms in the binding and what they are providing in
terms of API.  There is also a view called "Installed DOMs" that will show the currently
loaded set of DOMs available in the Eclipse workbench for you to use.
</p>

<center>
<img src="images/installedDOMs.png">
</center>

<p>
There is now the ability to rename DOM variable names for your current script in order to handle conflicts
between DOM plugins or to pick names that more suit you.  To accomplish this you use a notation very similar
to Groovy Maps.  DOM variables declared in the 'Default' DOM Descriptor cannot as of now be remapped.  The
following shows an example whereby in this script the 'out' binding variable is renamed to 'myOut' and the 
'launchManager ' binding variable is renamed to 'launch'.
</p>
<pre>
<code>
/*
 * Menu: Open Dialog > Groovy
 * Kudos: ervinja
 * License: EPL 1.0
 * Job: UIJob
 * DOM: http://groovy-monkey.sourceforge.net/update/plugins/net.sf.groovyMonkey.dom [ myOut:out, launch:launchManager ]
 */
myOut.println( 'hello world' )
</code>
</pre>
<h3>Objects of all Kinds</h3>

<p>
Scripts manipulate script objects such as strings and arrays, 
native Java objects including native Eclipse objects, 
and special DOM objects made specifically to simplify scripting.
</p>

<p>
Native Java objects can be accessed through their fully qualified class names.
This does depend on the syntax and environment of the target scripting language.
The following are examples in the given languages.

                                                         'Monkey Dialog', 
                                                         'Hello World' )

<p>
One of the challenges in scripting for Eclipse is dealing with the restricted 
namespaces of the various plug-ins (a.k.a. classloader hell). The classes and packages 
that are directly referencable are those in the plug-in pre-requisites of the 
net.sf.groovyMonkey plug-in such as org.eclipse.ui and org.eclipse.jface.text.  The list
of available plugins is included in the content outline view provided with the 
Groovy Monkey editor. To use other packages and classes, you must use the <b>DOM:</b>, 
<b>Include:</b> or <b>Include-Bundle:</b> script metadata tags (see below).
</p>

<h3>Built-In DOM Objects</h3>

<p>
DOM objects appear as globals in the script namespace which correspond to beans declared
in the binding. Some DOMs are primitively supported, others are supplied by DOM plug-ins 
(standard Eclipse plug-ins that contribute an net.sf.groovyMonkey.dom extensions). 
The built-in DOMs available with this release are:

<ul>
<li>bsf -> class org.apache.bsf.util.BSFFunctions</li>
<li>bundleDOM -> class net.sf.groovyMonkey.dom.bundle.BundleDOM</li>
<li>bundlerDOM -> class net.sf.groovyMonkey.dom.bundler.Bundler</li>
<li>jface -> class groovy.jface.JFaceBuilder</li>
<li>monitor -> class org.eclipse.core.runtime.SubProgressMonitor</li>
<li>project -> class net.sf.groovyMonkey.dom.project.Project</li>
<li>resources -> class net.sf.groovyMonkey.dom.resources.Resources</li>
<li>runnerDOM -> class net.sf.groovyMonkey.dom.runner.RunnerDOM</li>
<li>window -> interface org.eclipse.ui.IWorkbenchWindow</li>
<li>workspace -> interface org.eclipse.core.resources.IWorkspace</li>
</ul>

<h3>Plug-In DOM Objects</h3>

Plugin-DOMs are specified in the metadata with the <b>DOM:</b> 
tag who's value is a URI of the form:

<blockquote>
http://<i>&lt;update-site&gt;</i>/<i>&lt;dom-plugin-ID&gt;</i>
</blockquote>

The &lt;update-site&gt; refers to a normal Eclipse Update Manager update site. 
The &lt;dom-plugin-ID&gt; is the unique ID of the plug-in that supplies the DOM 
(via the net.sf.groovyMonkey.dom extension point). 
Groovy Monkey checks to be sure that all specified DOMs are loaded and notifies 
you if they aren't. 

<center>
<img src="images/missing-dom-dialog.png">
</center>

<p>
If you ask, Groovy Monkey will open an approximately configured update dialog 
to load missing DOMs:
</p>

<center>
<img src="images/missing-dom-update.png">
</center>
<h4>Standard DOM Objects</h4>

<p>
The following DOMs are contributed by the <code>net.sf.groovyMonkey.dom</code> plug-in
</p>

<ul>
<li>launchManager -> class net.sf.groovyMonkey.dom.launch.LaunchManagerDOM</li>
<li>out -> class net.sf.groovyMonkey.dom.console.ConsoleDOM</li>
</ul>

<p>
Learn about these DOM through the examples or by reading the source code of the 
Groovy Monkey Standard DOMs plug-in (net.sf.groovyMonkey.dom).
</p>

<h3>Include: metadata tag</h3>
<p>
Lets say you have a jar that is available to use in your workspace and you do not
want to go through the headache of wrapping it in a DOM plugin and deploying it to
you local workspace, how do you handle it?  You handle it by use of the <b>Include:</b>
metadata tag.  The <b>Include:</b> metadata tag takes a string that represents a path
in your current workspace that will be added to the classloader handed to the scripting
engine.
</p>

<h3>Include-Bundle: metadata tag</h3>
<p>
This is a bit of an experimental effort that I believe has been superseeded by
further work and investigation into dynamically deploying and updating DOM bundles
in the current Eclipse workbench.  It is still offered as a feature that might be
helpful.  If your script requires a plugin that is not included in the dependency
chain of the net.sf.groovyMonkey plugin you can request that it be added to the 
classloader for the script by use of the <b>Include-Bundle:</b> tag.  The 
<b>Include-Bundle:</b> tag takes the plugin symbolic name as the second argument.
The content outline page provided by the Groovy Monkey Editor will show you if a
requested DOM or Bundle is not currently installed in the workbench.
</p>
<p>
One thing to note about this tag is that it is completely dependent on the Bean 
Scripting Framework implementation of the target language.  I have had some success
with this feature using Groovy, Beanshell and, after a quick hack of the source code,
JRuby.  I have yet to get this to run using Jython or Jacl.
</p>

<h3>Listener: metadata tag</h3>
<p>
There is more than one way to get Groovy Monkey to run your desired script.  The
<b>Listener:</b> metadata tag allows you to register your script to be triggered
if there is a ResourceChangedEvent in the workspace.  Since it is probably not
the best thing in the world that your script is interpreted and run everytime
anything in the workspace changes there is provision for an optional ( but highly
highly recommended ) filter string.  After the <b>Listener:</b> tag you have the
ability to type in a regular expression string that will be tested against the 
Resource Delta's and any children files' full paths.  If you leave the string blank
it is interpreted as a true and therefore you will get every change to the workspace.
</p>

<h3>Script-Path: metadata tag</h3>
<p>
The Groovy Monkey runtime automatically will maintain this tag for you.  It is designed
to be set to the workspace path of your script.  This hopefully makes pasting new
Groovy Monkey Scripts a bit easier.
