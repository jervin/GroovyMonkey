<h2>Running a script</h2>

<p>
Scripts can run by either selecting a script from the <em>Groovy Monkey</em> menu:
</p>

or by the right click popup menu from within the Groovy Monkey Editor itself:

<p>
Here is what the results more or less should be:

<p>
If there is a problem, an error dialog shows you it with some detailed information
including a stack trace. Depending on the BSFEngine implementation of the given 
language, the stack trace can actually point you to the line number of the script
where the failure has occured.  A future enhancement would allow direct navigation
from the stack trace to the problem script.

<h2>Listener: metadata tag</h2>

<p>
Groovy Monkey will listen to changes in the workspace with use of the <b>Listener:</b> 
metadata tag as is outlined in the help section on <a href="writing.html">"Writing Scripts"</a>.
</p>

<h2>Runner DOM</h2>

<p>
There is a DOM that is added to the default binding of every Groovy Monkey Script that
is bound to the variable name runnerDOM.  As can be seen below from a screenshot of
the Groovy Monkey Editor Content Outline, it is an instance of the class RunnerDOM.
This DOM allows you to run other monkey scripts from within the context of your 
current script ( See Note: below about the use of UIJob and this DOM ) and is therefore
another way to invoke Groovy Monkey Scripts.  In particular, this DOM was created
by me in order to allow me to write monkey scripts that can be used as library 
routines.

<p>
You can use the outline view to directly view the source of the class if you have 
added the project "External Plug-in Libraries" into your workspace 
( see <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php/FAQ_How_do_I_find_a_particular_class_from_an_Eclipse_plug-in%3F">Eclipse Wiki FAQ</a> ) 
by double clicking the RunnerDOM class node in the tree.  Try it, you'll like it.
</p>

<p>
The API of this class can be a bit daunting (my bad...), so just focus on the 
simplest and functional runScript() method which takes two arguments. The arguments are 
the workspace path to the script to be executed a Map&lt String, Object &gt instance 
that will be used to augment and override the binding of the script to be executed.  
Think of the map instance as arguments to the other script.  Since the Bean Scripting 
Framework (BSF) allows scripts to be evaluated and return a value, this is what 
is returned as an Object instance from the runScript method.  This is done synchronously
from the context of the current script and so will block the Job context of the current
script until the other script completes ( see Note: below ). So you can invoke a
script as a function and get its return value.  The other method signature of note allows
you to invoke a script and pass it a progress monitor.  This runScript method will force
the target script to be invoked from within the current Job ( Thread ) context as the
current script and therefore will override the Job mode specified for the target script.
The use of runScript() with the progress monitor is therefore not encouraged.  
The rest of the methods in the class are convenience methods like file(), sync() 
and asyncExec().
</p>

<h3>Note: UIJob mode and Runner DOM</h3>

<p>
There is an issue here with running the script from within the SWT UI Thread
either from using async/syncExec() or the use of the UIJob mode.  Since every script
that is invoked is started with its own Eclipse Job context and there can be only one
UI Thread, there is a problem with scripts that are running as UIJobs attempting to
run other scripts that are marked as UIJobs or try to invoke async/syncExec internally.
If a script running in UIMode or from within a block invoked from within async/syncExec
tries to call a script that is set to run in UIJob mode, it will be invoked asynchronously
and the return value from runScript() will be meaningless.  Worse yet is if the
target script attempts to syncExec() a block internally, in which case a real nice
deadlock can occur.
</p>

<p>
There are two resolutions to the issue above: a bad one and the good one.  The bad
solution involves use of the runScript() method that takes a progress monitor.  This
forces the target script to run in the Job context of the current script regardless
of what it says the Job mode should be.  For obvious reasons this is a solution that
is a bit dicey, but on rare occasions can be useful.  The good solution is to avoid
the use of the UIJob mode all together and run your script in the normal Job mode,
using RunnerDOM's syncExec and asyncExec methods only on those specific parts that
are needed to access UI elements.  If a script is obviously just a GUI script, then
try and make sure that the script that invokes it is in regular Job mode.
