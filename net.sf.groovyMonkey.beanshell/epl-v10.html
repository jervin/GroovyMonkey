<P><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">"Contribution" means:</SPAN> </P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">a) 
in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation 
distributed under this Agreement, and<BR clear=left>b) in the case of each 
subsequent Contributor:</SPAN></P>

changes to the Program, and</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">ii) 
additions to the Program;</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">where such changes and/or additions to the Program 
originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A 
Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by 
such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. 
Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate 
modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own 
license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program. </SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">"Contributor" means any person or entity that 
distributes the Program.</SPAN> </P>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">"Licensed Patents " mean patent claims 
licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale 
of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program. </SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">"Program" means the Contributions distributed 
in accordance with this Agreement.</SPAN> </P>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">"Recipient" means anyone who receives the 
Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.</SPAN> </P>
<P><B><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">2. GRANT OF RIGHTS</SPAN></B> </P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">a) 
Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient 
a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to<SPAN 
style="COLOR: red"> </SPAN>reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly 
display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such 
Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code 
form.</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">b) 
Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient 
a non-exclusive, worldwide,<SPAN style="COLOR: green"> </SPAN>royalty-free 
patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import 
and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source 
code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of 
the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by 
the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be 
covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other 
combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed 
hereunder. </SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">c) 
Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its 
Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor 
that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property 
rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to 
Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of 
intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the 
rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole 
responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. 
For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to 
distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license 
before distributing the Program.</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">d) 
Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright 
rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in 
this Agreement. </SPAN></P>
<P><B><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">3. REQUIREMENTS</SPAN></B> </P>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">A Contributor may choose to distribute the 
Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided 
that:</SPAN> </P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">a) 
it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">b) 
its license agreement:</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">i) 
effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and 
conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and 
non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and 
fitness for a particular purpose; </SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">ii) 
effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, 
including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such 
as lost profits; </SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">iii) 
states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that 
Contributor alone and not by any other party; and</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">iv) 
states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and 
informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium 
customarily used for software exchange.<SPAN style="COLOR: blue"> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">When the Program is made available in source 
code form:</SPAN> </P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">a) 
it must be made available under this Agreement; and </SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">b) a 
copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program. 
</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Contributors may not remove or alter any 
copyright notices contained within the Program. </SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Each Contributor must identify itself as the 
originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows 
subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution. 
</SPAN></P>
<P><B><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION</SPAN></B> </P>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Commercial distributors of software may accept 
certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the 
like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the 
Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product 
offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for 
other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a 
commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby 
agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified 
Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") 
arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party 
against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or 
omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of 
the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do 
not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual 
property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) 
promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) 
allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial 
Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The 
Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own 
expense.</SPAN> </P>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">For example, a Contributor might include the 
Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a 
Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance 
claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and 
warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this 
section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the 
other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a 
court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the 
Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.</SPAN> </P>
<P><B><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">5. NO WARRANTY</SPAN></B> </P>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS 
AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR 
CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, 
ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR 
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for 
determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and 
assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement , 
including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance 
with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and 
unavailability or interruption of operations. </SPAN></P>
<P><B><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY</SPAN></B> </P>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS 
AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR 
ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES 
(INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF 
LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE 
OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM 
OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE 
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</SPAN> </P>
<P><B><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">7. GENERAL</SPAN></B> </P>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">If any provision of this Agreement is invalid 
or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or 
enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without 
further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the 
minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.</SPAN> 
</P>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">If Recipient institutes patent litigation 
against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) 
alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with 
other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such 
Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date 
such litigation is filed. </SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">All Recipient's rights under this Agreement 
shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or 
conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable 
period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's 
rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and 
distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, 
Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by 
Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive. </SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute 
copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is 
copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement 
Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this 
Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the 
right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement 
Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the 
Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the 
Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including 
Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement 
under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement 
is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its 
Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 
2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the 
intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether 
expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not 
expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.</SPAN> </P>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">This Agreement is governed by the laws of the 
State of New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States of 
America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this 
Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives 
its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.</SPAN> </P>
